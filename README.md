# Python-Whatsapp-Chatbot
A chatbot built in python using Selenium module.

Currently the chatbot is only capable of the following tasks:

## 1. News show
Run News.py to start the bot with the news mode ON. Any message you will get after you run the bot having the word "news" in it will be treated as a request for latest headlines. The bot then fetches the latest news. Feel free to improve the code and make a pull request.

## 2. Image Captioning Bot
A bot that captions the image sent to you using Microsoft's Azure platform. You will need an API key from Azure to run this. If you dont have one, you can make your own "caption" function and play around the image.
